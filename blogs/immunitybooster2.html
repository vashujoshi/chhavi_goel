        <h3>
          1. Iron: Essential for Oxygen Transport and Immune Cell Production
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Iron</strong> plays a vital role in hemoglobin synthesis,
          enabling red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body. Low iron
          levels can impair immune response, affecting the production and
          proliferation of immune cells, particularly lymphocytes. Adequate iron
          intake is key for maintaining a strong immune system and preventing
          anemia, which can lead to fatigue and increased vulnerability to
          infections.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Top Sources of Iron:</strong> Red meat, poultry, and fish,
          Shellfish (especially oysters, clams), Eggs, legumes, and lentils,
          Fortified cereals, dried fruits (apricots, raisins)
        </p>

        <section class="selenium">
        <h3>2. Selenium: Antioxidant Support and Immune Function</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Selenium</strong> is essential for proper immune function,
          thyroid hormone metabolism, and vitamin C utilization. It works in
          tandem with vitamin E to reduce oxidative stress and combat free
          radicals, which can damage cells. Adequate selenium intake boosts
          immunity by supporting the production of immune cells and enhancing
          the body’s defense mechanisms.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Rich Sources of Selenium:</strong> Seafood (tuna, shrimp,
          salmon), Meat, poultry, and dairy products, Whole grains, Brazil nuts,
          and sunflower seeds, Fruits and vegetables (depending on soil selenium
          levels)

        <section class="zinc">
        <h3>3. Zinc: The Key to Wound Healing and Immune Regulation</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Zinc</strong> is critical for immune cell function, skin
          integrity, and gene regulation within immune cells like lymphocytes.
          It has a profound effect on both innate and adaptive immune responses.
          Both zinc deficiency and excess can alter immune cell numbers and
          activity, increasing susceptibility to infections and inflammatory
          diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Top Food Sources of Zinc:</strong> Meats (beef, lamb, pork),
          Seafood (especially oysters and crab), Beans, mushrooms, whole grains,
          Fortified cereals and dairy products
        </p>

        <h3>
          4. Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine): Essential for Red Blood Cell and Immune
          System Health
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Vitamin B6</strong> is important for the immune system's
          strength, red blood cell production, and oxygen transportation. It
          also plays a role in maintaining brain health and regulating mood.
          Studies have shown that B6 supplementation can help alleviate symptoms
          of certain conditions like migraines while improving immune function.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Best Sources of Vitamin B6:</strong> Poultry (chicken,
          turkey), Fish (salmon, tuna), Leafy greens and chickpeas, Bananas and
          fortified cereals
        </p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="copper">
        <h3>5. Copper: Supporting Immune Cells and Antioxidant Defense</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Copper</strong> is crucial for immune function, aiding in the
          production of antibodies and the activity of phagocytes, which engulf
          harmful pathogens. Copper deficiency has been associated with impaired
          immune responses, leading to higher infection rates and slower
          recovery times.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Foods Rich in Copper:</strong> Shellfish (especially oysters
          and crabs), Nuts and seeds (almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds), Organ
          meats (liver, kidneys), Whole grains and dark chocolate

        <section class="hydration">
        <h3>6. Hydration: The Foundation of Immune Health</h3>
        <p>
          Adequate hydration is essential for the immune system, as water helps
          transport nutrients throughout the body. Proper hydration supports
          digestion, nutrient absorption, and the removal of toxins. Without
          enough water, the body struggles to deliver immune-boosting nutrients
          to vital organs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Stay Hydrated By Drinking:</strong> Water, herbal teas,
          Hydrating fruits and vegetables (cucumbers, watermelon), Electrolyte
          drinks (in moderation)

        <h3>7. Sleep: Critical for a Balanced Immune Response</h3>
        <p>
          Quality sleep is essential for maintaining a healthy immune system.
          Research shows that sleep supports both innate and adaptive immunity,
          enhances vaccine efficacy, and lowers the risk of infection. Chronic
          sleep deprivation, such as from insomnia or sleep apnea, can severely
          impair immune function, making the body more susceptible to illness.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Tips for Better Sleep:</strong> Maintain a consistent sleep
          schedule, Create a relaxing bedtime routine, Avoid caffeine and screen
          time before bed
