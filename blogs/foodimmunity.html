  <p>What to Eat for a Stronger Immune System</p>
</header>

<div class="container">
  <h2>Your Immune System and Diet</h2>
  <p>Your immune system is your body’s first line of defense against infections, and what you eat can have a big impact on its effectiveness. By incorporating nutrient-dense foods into your diet, you can give your immune system the fuel it needs to fight off illness. Here are some of the best foods to boost your immunity naturally:</p>

  <h2>1. Citrus Fruits: Vitamin C Powerhouse</h2>
  <p>Citrus fruits like oranges, grapefruits, lemons, and limes are rich in vitamin C, which is known to increase the production of white blood cells, a key player in fighting infections. Since the body cannot store or produce vitamin C, daily consumption is crucial.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Top choices: Oranges, Grapefruit, Lemons, Limes, Tangerines</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Garlic: The Immune-Boosting Bulb</h2>
  <p>Garlic is widely recognized for its immune-boosting properties. Its sulfur-containing compounds, such as allicin, have been shown to enhance the immune response by increasing the production of disease-fighting white blood cells.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How to use: Add raw or cooked garlic to soups, stir-fries, or roasted vegetables.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Ginger: Anti-Inflammatory Benefits</h2>
  <p>Ginger is known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. It helps decrease inflammation, which can boost the immune system, and is particularly useful for easing sore throats and other inflammatory conditions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Incorporate it: Use fresh ginger in teas, smoothies, or as a flavor enhancer in curries and soups.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Spinach: Packed with Nutrients</h2>
  <p>Spinach is a nutrient-dense leafy green that is loaded with vitamin C, antioxidants, and beta-carotene, all of which may enhance the infection-fighting ability of the immune system. To retain most of its nutrients, it’s best to eat spinach lightly cooked.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Other options: Kale, Swiss chard, and collard greens.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Incorporating these immune-boosting foods into your daily diet can help strengthen your immune system and keep you healthy. A well-balanced diet, combined with adequate sleep, exercise, and stress management, is the best defense against illness.</p>
